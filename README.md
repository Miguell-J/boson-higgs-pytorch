## 🌟 Project Overview

An advanced binary classification implementation using Deep Neural Networks to identify Higgs Boson events in high-energy particle physics experimental data.

## 🧲 The Higgs Boson: A Fundamental Particle

### Physical Significance
The Higgs Boson is a fundamental particle discovered in 2012 at CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC), representing a monumental breakthrough in particle physics. It is the quantum excitation of the Higgs field, a fundamental field of crucial importance in the Standard Model of particle physics.

### The Higgs Mechanism
- Explains how fundamental particles acquire mass
- Validates the Standard Model of particle physics
- Discovered through extremely complex and rare decay processes
- Predicted theoretically in 1964, experimentally confirmed in 2012

### Decay Characteristics
The Higgs Boson is extremely unstable, decaying almost immediately into other particles. The dataset we're using captures these complex decay signatures, which are challenging to distinguish from background noise.
